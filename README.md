# Project_Dashboard
In this project we use Alpaca and Pandas to analyze the risk and return of stocks held by ETFs ranked by money.usnews.com as seen here in this page:https://money.usnews.com/funds/etfs/sector
For our analysis we looked at 12 different ETFs; RYT, XSW and FTEC in the tech sector; USRT, XLRE and RWR in the Real Estate sector; as well as BBUS, SPMD and SLY in the large mid and small growth rankings respectively; and lastly JMOM, MDYG, and SLYG in the Large Mid and Small growth rankings respectively.
Through our analysis, we we were able to create an ETF of our own, consisting of the of the most promising stocks in each of the listed ETFs.
